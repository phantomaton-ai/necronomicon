# Necronomicon

Necronomicon is a project that combines the `gallows` execution framework and the `smarkup` directive parser to create a collection of executable commands. It allows you to define a set of commands that can be seamlessly embedded and executed within text-based documents. This can be particularly useful for building more powerful chatbots and text processing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

The rest of the README content remains the same.
